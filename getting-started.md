Preparing datasets
==================

To be able to view your image datasets in **Knossos**, they have to be converted into a **Knossos**-readable format. You can use our `knossos_cuber` Python script for this. Right now the Python script is available from [our repository](https://github.com/knossos-project/knossos/tree/master/knossos_cuber)<sup>&dagger;</sup>.

Look at the accompanying `README` file to learn how to use `knossos_cuber`.

<sup>&dagger;</sup>We plan to release this script on *PyPi* and as a standalone program soon
