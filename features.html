  <p><strong>Knossos</strong> is a tool for the <b>visualization and annotation of 3D image data</b>, and was developed for the <b>rapid reconstruction of neural morphology and connectivity</b> at <b>Max Planck Institute for Medical Research</b></p>

  <p>By dynamically loading only data from the surround of the current view point, seamless navigation is <b>not limited to datasets that fit into the available RAM</b> but works with much larger dataset stored in a special format on disk.</p>

  <p>In addition to viewing and navigating, <strong>Knossos</strong> allows <b>efficient manual neurite annotation</b> (&#8220;skeletonization&#8221;).</p>

      <p><strong>Knossos</strong> is mostly being used <b>to reconstruct cell morphologies from 3D electron microscopic data</b> that was generated by Serial Block-Face Electron Microscopy (SBEM) (with an occasional application to 2-photon and confocal optical microscopy data).</p>

  <p>At Max Planck Institute, <strong>Knossos</strong> is employed to trace the neurons of zebra finks and zebra fish, among other use cases. Several other groups also use <strong>Knossos</strong> for the annotation of SBEM and other datasets. While the development is still on-going, <strong>Knossos</strong> already appeared in some articles publicized in <em>Nature</em>.</p>
