Getting Started
===============

Download **Knossos**
--------------------
**Knossos** is available for Windows, GNU/Linux and OS X. Since **Knossos** is an open-source program, we host our releases on Github. Head to our [Github repository {% include fa.html icon="fa-external-link" %}](https://github.com/knossos-project/knossos) to download the appropriate version.

Datasets
--------
Since a special image format is required to use **Knossos**, you have the choice to either try our example datasets, or learn how to create your own. Any dataset can be loaded into **Knossos** by selecting its `.conf` file in `File - Load Dataset...`


### Streaming Datasets

**Knossos** allows datasets to be streamed, so that it is not necessary to download a large amount of images. These streamed datasets are available here: [`e2006`]({{ "/downloads/e2006.zip" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), [`ek0563`]({{ "/downloads/ek0563.zip" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

### Offline Datasets

These are offline datasets that already contain all images: [`small (54 MB)`]({{ "/downloads/e1088_mag1_small.zip" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), [`large (400 MB)`]({{ "/downloads/e1088_mag1_large.zip" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

### Own datasets

If you have your own image datasets, they will probably need to be converted into **Knossos'** format. Head to the  [Dataset Preparation]({{ "/start/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) section to learn how to do so.

Feel free to [contact us](#contact) if you need any assistance in setting up **Knossos**.
