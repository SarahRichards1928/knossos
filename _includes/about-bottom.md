Getting started
===============

Download Knossos
----------------
**Knossos** is available for Windows, GNU/Linux and OS X. Since **Knossos** is an open-source program, we host our releases on Github. Head to our [Github repository {% include fa.html icon="fa-external-link" %}](https://github.com/knossos-project/knossos) to download the appropriate version of **Knossos** for your system.

Example datasets
----------------
If you want to take a look at **Knossos**, but need a dataset to try it out, you can download two example datasets here: [`small (54 MB)`]({{ "/downloads/e1088_mag1_small.zip" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), [`large (400 MB)`]({{ "/downloads/e1088_mag1_large.zip" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

An image dataset can be loaded into **Knossos** by selecting its `.conf` file in `File - Load Dataset...`

Streaming datasets
------------------
**Knossos** also allows datasets to be streamed, so that it is not necessary to download a large amount of images. Load the following `.conf` files into **Knossos** for the streamed datasets: [`e2006`]({{ "/downloads/e2006.zip" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), [`ek0563`]({{ "/downloads/ek0563.zip" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Own datasets
------------
If you have own image datasets, they will probably need to be converted into **Knossos'** format. Head to the  [Getting started]({{ "/start/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) section to learn how to do so.

Feel free to <a href="#contact">contact us</a> if you need any assistance in setting up **Knossos**.
