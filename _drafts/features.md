**Knossos** was created to annotate 3D image data for research on nervous systems. This annotation can be done in the following two ways:

1.  Skeletonization, i.e. the mapping of geometric and topological properties of an object, for instance branching and connectivity of neurons.
2.  Segmentation, i.e. the partitioning of an area into smaller regions. This also allows to reconstruct an object's volume.
