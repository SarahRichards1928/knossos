What is **Knossos**?
====================

**Knossos** is a tool for the *visualization and annotation of 3D image data*,
and was developed for the *rapid reconstruction of neural morphology and connectivity*
at *Max Planck Institute for Medical Research*

By dynamically loading only data from the surround of the current view point,
seamless navigation is *not limited to datasets that fit into the available RAM*
but works with much larger dataset stored in a special format on disk.

In addition to viewing and navigating, **Knossos** allows *efficient manual neurite annotation*
("skeletonization").

being used *to reconstruct cell morphologies from 3D electron microscopic data*
that was generated by Serial Block-Face Electron Microscopy (SBEM)
(with an occasional application to 2-photon and confocal optical microscopy data).

Features
========

Skeletonization
---------------

*Skeletonization* is the process of annotating the geometrical and topological properties of an object, such as

*   connectivity,
*   length,
*   and direction,

*but without regard to that object's volume*.

Segmentation
------------

With a *Segmentation*, a dataset is partitioned into multiple objects.

Different than skeletonization, this also annotates volume, and allows a full visual reconstruction of the object.

Below, you can see the segmentation in **Knossos**.

Merge feature
-------------

You can load pre-segmented datasets into **Knossos** to review and correct them.
Use the *Merge feature* to fill up holes or to merge areas together with a single click!
