<h1>3D Visualization</h1>
<p class="margin-bottom">View 3D images as 2D representation of each side, allowing you to easily navigate through datasets. By dynamically loading only data from the surrounding of the current location, seamless navigation is not limited to datasets that fit into the available RAM but also works with much larger datasets stored in **Knossos'** special format on disk.</p>


<h1>Open Source &amp; Cross-platform</h1>
<p class="margin-bottom">**Knossos** is available on all major platforms by using the *Qt 5* GUI toolkit. You can help the development of **Knossos** by submitting bugs and other suggestions within [Github's issue tracker {% include fa.html icon="fa-external-link" %}](https://github.com/knossos-project/knossos/issues) or by contacting us directly.</p>

<h1>3D Annotation</h1>
<p>Using **Knossos'** annotation tools, you can build 3D skeletons of your data by placing and connecting nodes *(with 3D volume annotation coming soon)*.</p>

<p class="margin-bottom">This is already being used at *Max Planck Institute for Medical Research* where several employees work together to skeletonize neurons and their connections.</p>

<h1>Easily prepare your data for **Knossos**</h1>
<p>**Knossos** ships together with a Python script---*Knossos Cuber*---that makes it easy to prepare any image data for use within **Knossos**.</p>
