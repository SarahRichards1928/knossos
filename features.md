What is **Knossos**
===================

**Knossos** is a tool for the *visualization and annotation of 3D image data*, and was developed for the *rapid reconstruction of neural morphology and connectivity* at *Max Planck Institute for Medical Research* in Heidelberg, Germany.

By dynamically loading only data from the surround of the current view point, seamless navigation is *not limited to datasets that fit into the available RAM* but works with much larger dataset stored in a special format on disk.

In addition to viewing and navigating, **Knossos** allows efficient manual *neurite annotation* ("skeletonization").

**Knossos** is mostly being used to *reconstruct cell morphologies* from 3D electron microscopic data that was generated by Serial Block-Face Electron Microscopy (SBEM) (with an occasional application to 2-photon and confocal optical microscopy data).

At Max Planck Institute, **Knossos** is employed to trace the neurons of zebra finks and zebra fish, among other use cases. Several other groups also use Knossos for the annotation of SBEM and other datasets. While the development is still on-going, Knossos already appeared in some articles publicized in *Nature*.
